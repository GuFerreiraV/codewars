/// In this kata, you will write a function that returns the positions and the values of the "peaks" (or local maxima) of a numeric array.
/// For example, the array arr = [0, 1, 2, 5, 1, 0] has a peak at position 3 with a value of 5 (since arr[3] equals 5).
/// 
/// The output will be returned as a Dictionary<string, List<int>> with two key-value pairs: "pos" and "peaks". 
/// If there is no peak in the given array, simply return {"pos" => new List<int>(), "peaks" => new List<int>()}.
/// 
/// The first and last elements of the array will not be considered as peaks 
/// (in the context of a mathematical function, we don't know what is after and before and therefore, we don't know if it is a peak or not).
/// 
/// Also, beware of plateaus !!! [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] has a peak while [1, 2, 2, 2, 3] and [1, 2, 2, 2, 2] do not. 
/// In case of a plateau-peak, please only return the position and value of the beginning of the plateau. 
/// For example: pickPeaks([1, 2, 2, 2, 1]) returns {pos: [1], peaks: [2]} (or equivalent in other languages)
